Summarizes and translates YouTube videos with the specified language

![Example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64767959/212521125-24274752-29c4-4bef-a53e-0dd94521781e.gif)


## What it does

YouTube Helper is a tool that can automatically summarize the content of a YouTube video, providing a brief summary of the main points or key takeaways. The summary would be in the form of text shown in the extension popup. It can also automatically translate the spoken or written text in a YouTube video from one language to another. 


## How we built it

We develop the YouTube Helper using common web technologies such HTML, CSS and NodeJS. We also used the Chrome Extensions API to interact with the browser. Then, we incorporated ChatGPT to offer content summaries and translations.
